          This app displays all texts of the gregorian Chants sing during the
          year ( the Proper)
          with their translations in French and in German and the music sheets
          and texts necessary to sing the Offices of the Holy Week in Gregorian
          Chants.
          Only the Horae Majores (Ad Laudes et Ad Vesperas)
          and the Horae Minores (Ad Tertiam, Ad Sextam et Ad Nonam) are
          published.
